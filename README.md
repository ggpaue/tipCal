# tipCal
simple tip calculation program, implemented in Swift 
This is a tip calculation application for iOS submitted as the pre work requirement

Completed:
  Main application view: people could input a bill amount(this is the first responder on the view). They can choose a tip percentage to see the tip amount and total amount. If people want to split this bill, they can see how much each person will cost.
  Settings view: people could set the theme on settings view(day use or night use). They could also set the default tip percentage used in this app for calculation
  Addional: Settings page view color is same with Main application view and app could remember the current default tip percentage for next time use.

Notes: 
This app is recommended to run on iPhone 5s. 
I did not try to make the app look right on other iOS screen sizes.
