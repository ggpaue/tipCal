# tipCal
simple tip calculation program, implemented in Swift 
This is a tip calculation application for iOS submitted as the pre work requirement
Completed:
  Main view: people could input a bill amount(this is the first responder on the view). They can choose a tip percentage to see the tip amount and total amount. If people want to split this bill, they can see how much each person will cost.
Notes: 
This app is recommended to run on iPhone 5s. 
I did not try to make the app look right on other iOS screen sizes.
